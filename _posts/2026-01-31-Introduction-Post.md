I'd like to start by saying that this post had more hiccups than I care to admit. Although overall the assignment is fairly lax compared to what's to come, it had me dwelling for hours on something that could have been done in minutes. Mainly things like getting Ruby on my desktop. Oh, you know not the indescribable woe that was cascaded over my ignorant soul. My computer was steadfast in its diagnoses on Ruby being a Bitcoin miner that would take every percent of my GPU and feed some offshore Lithuanian deadbeat. But that's in the past, and I’ve gotten everything to work now.


This stepping-stone of a project was a nice practice run for the GitHub pages setup, as well as how to host a webpage on a local device. I also hope that this blogging system helps to keep me in check and will provide a visual representation of my growth throughout this class.


Seeing as this is only an introduction post, I think it should be the best of my posts, as there is really nothing else to comment on at this time. So I bid you a good evening, or afternoon, or, if you are for somereason reading this at an unreasonable hour, good morning.
