In this lab the only thing really new to me was learning more about how to connect all of these different pieces and parts. That also falls in line with what I found diffcult aswell. Figuring out
how how to sawp the title and dates for a page took me a moment as all that code in such a small space made for a hard disection. But, like all things, it was solved in due time, and more resources
managment expected. Also, learning more about CSS style, I had to go through some [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) to try and spruce up the home page, and add that nice little line between each post now.

For what I hope to leanr in the coming projects? I have no clue. If anything, I really need to spruce up on the basics. Figure out CSS, work on connecting the HTML to other portions of the website. The problem for me is is that I find this concept so facinating, yet, even though we're only a few weeks in, I feel like I'm falling behind. I know I'm not, but I feel that I'm already struggling. Seeing other peoples Lab 1's made me feel quite small. But, thats the whole point, I need to take these examples and learn, to ask my self "How can I be more like them?" or "What are they doing that I'm not?". I would assume many things, but its best if we take things step by step; maybe continue those lessons on [Codecadamy](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/make-a-website)?

I've already come so far, yet theres still so much I need to learn. So, maybe thats what I hope for, to learn more, to be an example to my peers, to have Dr. Goadrich have my website on the board and commend its beauty, its charm, so on and so forth. But, little steps first, so maybe I'll go ahead and polish off that Codecadamy class.
