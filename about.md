I am a senior at Hendrix Collage looking to major in computer sciences. I really have no idea what else to write about in this section; but I think it would look nice if I pad
it out. So maybe I'll write another paragraph worth of random information for you to read about.

This is another paragraph, thats how writing works. You split text up in sections to make reading more digestable, like so. Or, I guess, not like now as the split happened before this paragraph, but after the first. An inbetween state. A space between smaller, more concises spaces. Writing is cool in that way, infinite combinations of texts and spaces can creat an unlimited amount of ideas.
